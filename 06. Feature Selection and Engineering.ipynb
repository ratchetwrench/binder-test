    "# Feature Selection For Machine Learning\n",
    "The data features that you use to train your machine learning models have a huge influence on the performance you can achieve. Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact model performance. In this chapter you will discover automatic feature selection techniques that you can use to prepare your machine learning data in Python with scikit-learn. After completing this lesson you will know how to use:\n",

    "## Feature Selection\n",
    "Feature selection is a process where you automatically select those features in your data that contribute most to the prediction variable or output in which you are interested. Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of many models, especially linear algorithms like linear and logistic regression. Three benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data are:\n",
    "- **Reduces Overfitting**: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.\n",
    "- **Improves Accuracy**: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.\n",
    "- **Reduces Training Time**: Less data means that algorithms train faster.\n",
    "You can learn more about feature selection with scikit-learn in the article Feature selection1.\n",

The scikit-learn library provides the SelectKBest class2 that can be used with a suite of diâ†µerent statistical tests to select a specific number of features. The example below uses the chi-squared (chi2) statistical test for non-negative features to select 4 of the best features from the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset."

    "The Recursive Feature Elimination (or RFE) works by recursively removing attributes and building a model on those attributes that remain. It uses the model accuracy to identify which attributes (and combination of attributes) contribute the most to predicting the target attribute. You can learn more about the RFE class3 in the scikit-learn documentation. The example below uses RFE with the logistic regression algorithm to select the top 3 features. The choice of algorithm does not matter too much as long as it is skillful and consistent."

A property of PCA is that you can choose the number of dimensions or principal components in the transformed result. In the example below, we use PCA and select 3 principal components. Learn more about the PCA class in scikit-learn by reviewing the API4."
