    "## Automating Machine Learning Workflows \n",
    "There are standard workflows in applied machine learning. Standard because they overcome common problems like data leakage in your test harness. Python scikit-learn provides a Pipeline utility to help automate machine learning workflows. Pipelines work by allowing for a linear sequence of data transforms to be chained together culminating in a modeling process that can be evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to ensure that all of the steps in the pipeline are constrained to the data available for the evaluation, such as the training dataset or each fold of the cross-validation procedure. You can learn more about Pipelines in scikit-learn by reading the Pipeline section1 of the user guide. You can also review the API documentation for the Pipeline and FeatureUnion classes and the pipeline module.\n",
    "Data Preparation and Modeling Pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "An easy trap to fall into in applied machine learning is leaking data from your training dataset to your test dataset. To avoid this trap, you need a robust test harness with strong separation of training and testing. This includes data preparation. Data preparation is one easy way to leak knowledge of the whole training dataset to the algorithm. For example, preparing your data using normalization or standardization on the entire training dataset before learning would not be a valid test because the training dataset would have been influenced by the scale of the data in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines help you prevent data leakage in your test harness by ensuring that data preparation like standardization is constrained to each fold of your cross validation procedure. The example below demonstrates this important data preparation and model evaluation workflow on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. The pipeline is defined with two steps: \n",
