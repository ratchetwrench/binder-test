    "# Prepare Your Data For Machine Learning\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms make assumptions about your data. It is often a very good idea to prepare your data in such way to best expose the structure of the problem to the machine learning algorithms that you intend to use. In this chapter you will discover how to prepare your data for machine learning in Python using scikit-learn. After completing this lesson you will know how to:\n",

    "## Rescale Data\n",
    "When your data is comprised of attributes with varying scales, many machine learning algorithms can benefit from rescaling the attributes to all have the same scale. Often this is referred to as normalization and attributes are often rescaled into the range between 0 and 1. This is useful for optimization algorithms in used in the core of machine learning algorithms like gradient descent. It is also useful for algorithms that weight inputs like regression and neural networks and algorithms that use distance measures like k-Nearest Neighbors. You can rescale your data using scikit-learn using the MinMaxScaler class2."

    "## Standardize Data\n",
    "Standardization is a useful technique to transform attributes with a Gaussian distribution and diâ†µering means and standard deviations to a standard Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is most suitable for techniques that assume a Gaussian distribution in the input variables and work better with rescaled data, such as linear regression, logistic regression and linear discriminate analysis. You can standardize data using scikit-learn with the StandardScaler class3."

    "## Normalize Data\n",
    "Normalizing in scikit-learn refers to rescaling each observation (row) to have a length of 1 (called a unit norm or a vector with the length of 1 in linear algebra). This pre-processing method can be useful for sparse datasets (lots of zeros) with attributes of varying scales when using algorithms that weight input values such as neural networks and algorithms that use distance measures such as k-Nearest Neighbors. You can normalize data in Python with scikit-learn using the Normalizer class4."

    "## Binarize Data\n",
    "You can transform your data using a binary threshold. All values above the threshold are marked 1 and all equal to or below are marked as 0. This is called binarizing your data or thresholding your data. It can be useful when you have probabilities that you want to make crisp values. It is also useful when feature engineering and you want to add new features that indicate something meaningful. You can create new binary attributes in Python using scikit-learn with the Binarizer class5."
